    "overview": "This subject consists of two parts: multivariate calculus and an introduction to statistics. The mathematical part develops the mathematical skills required for mathematical modelling of systems involving more than one independent variable. The statistics part is an introduction to descriptive statistics, statistical inference and simple linear regression. Topics include linear algebra, solutions to sets of equations resulting from particular problems, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, partial derivatives, optimisation, multiple integrals and their applications, and probability with a focus on the determination of the reliability of a system of components in various engineering contexts.Subject learning objectives (SLOs)Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:1.model real world problems in engineering practice using mathematical and statistical tools and resources2.use formal mathematical and statistical terminology and also informal (lay) language to express the concepts presented in the subject3.demonstrate a high level of skill in the mathematical and statistical techniques covered in the subject by both formulating and solving problems in engineering and science4.demonstrate understanding of the theoretical results which justify the use of these techniques5.communicate mathematical and statistical knowledge clearly, logically and critically6.use appropriate mathematical and statistical software packages to perform calculations and explore ideas relevant to the subject content7.apply the subject matter covered in lectures, computer labs, tutorials and assignments to previously unseen problems and proofs, especially in engineering and science.Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs)This subject also contributes specifically to the development of following course intended learning outcomes:Technically Proficient: FEIT graduates apply abstraction, mathematics and discipline fundamentals, software, tools and techniques to evaluate, implement and operate systems. (D.1)Collaborative and Communicative: FEIT graduates work as an effective member or leader of diverse teams, communicating effectively and operating within cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural contexts in the workplace. (E.1)Contribution to the development of graduate attributesEngineers Australia Stage 1 CompetenciesThis subject contributes to the development of the following Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies:1.2 Conceptual understanding of the mathematics, numerical analysis, statistics, and computer and information sciences which underpin the engineering discipline.3.2.

Time management skills, personal organisation skills, teamwork skills, computing skills, laboratory skills, data handling, quantitative and graphical literacy skills.Graduate Attribute 5 - CommunicationAn understanding of the different forms of communication - writing, reading, speaking, listening - including visual and graphical, within science and beyond and the ability to apply these appropriately and effectively for different audiences.Teaching and learning strategiesLectures:Two 90 minute lectures per weekLecture materials including detailed notes are provided in Canvas for students to read before the class. Concepts and definitions are explored through the use of both pure and applied examples. Students have the opportunity to make notes and question concepts.Tutorials:One one-hour tutorial per weekStudents are required to attempt problems posted in Canvas before they come to the tutorial. These problems develop the concepts delivered in the previous lecture. In class students can ask questions about areas they don't understand with either their peers or their tutors.Computer labs:Three one-hour computer labs and eight mastery test sessions (four tests with a second chance sitting)Students work in the computer labs individually and in pairs. There is a problem sheet made available in Canvas which students use to prepare before they come to the lab. During the class students interact with the tutors and other students to complete the problems. The three labs make use of a program called minitab. This practice allows students the opportunity to get feedback in preparation for the Mastery Tests.The Mastery Tests are interspersed between the computer labs. The material covered in the computer lab relates to the subsequent Mastery tests. After each test submission students get immediate feedback on correct or incorrect responses. The maths study centre is then available as a support mechanism for students to get feedback on incorrect responses and work through correct solutions. The subject coordinator will offer further feedback as a third step.Webassign is the program used for practice tests. These can be accessed online by students at any time during the semester and students receive immediate feedback after each question is submitted. These questions cover all of the subject materials.Forms of attendance in this subject online flexible. There will be subject announcements indicating opportunities to attend campus, alternatively all activities can be completed online.Content (topics)Topics include: linear algebra including eigenvalues and eigenvectors and applications; 3D geometry and functions of several variables; partial derivatives; optimisation; multiple integrals and their applications; probability with a focus on the determination of the reliability of a system of components in various engineering contexts; descriptive statistics, probability distributions, statistical inference, introduction to linear regression.Minitab is used in the statistics part of the subject.

It is led by a student who has previously achieved a distinction or high distinction in the subject area, and who has a good WAM. Leaders will prepare activities for you to work on in groups based on the content you are learning in lectures and tutorials. It’s really relaxed, friendly, and informal. Because the leader is a student just like you, they understand what it’s like to study the subject and how to do well, and they can pass those tips along to you. Students also say it’s a great way to meet new people and a “guaranteed study hour”.You can sign up for U:PASS sessions via U:PASS websitehttp://tinyurl.com/upass2017Note that sign up is not open until week 2, as it’s voluntary and only students who want to go should sign up.
